## Model outline

Let's assume we are researchers who are going to research on the relationship between age and type of crops grown, and where in the country (represented by counties).


We want to design a form that will collect responses to the following questions:

1. Researchers - a multi-select question that inserts the names of all researchers involved in the project.

2. Recorder - the person conducting the survey.

3. Responder name - the person responding to the survey (optional)

4. Location - the geographic coordinates of where the survey is being carried out. This field will collect the coordinates as a point layer.

5. Age - this is the age of the respondent 

6. Crops - a multi-select dropdown question that allows the recorder to select the crops grown

7. Image - an image of the respondent's farm (optional).

8. Comments - a textfield that allows the recorder to add any other information not collected above but that provides more context.
