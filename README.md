## Purpose of writing this book

I decided to write this book to help anyone else out there who desires to be taught Django in a friendly way. This book was intended to be a tutorial on how you would get basics of Django while building a very simple app. 

Though the books has its own limitations, inconsistencies and imperfections, it is my desire it will contribute to increasing your knowledge and understanding of how Django works.
